## Beta

### Motivation

- The buffer depletes due to one fundamental reason â€“ the client commits to downloading the segment that cannot complete before it is due to play

- Current VoD services:

  - Maintain a large buffer: waste of bandwidth
  - Replace original chunks with those of low quality: still does not guarantee stall-free experience

  Also, these methods result in lower visual quality (VQ)

- An ideal solution to live broadcasts' high requirement of low latency should be agile and robust to bandwidth variation in real time, and mitigate the consequences of sudden bandwidth reduction in a graceful manner

- Bandwidth Efficient Temporal Adaptation: enables HAS systems to adjust quality **at sub-segment granularity** and to play partially received segments by **exploiting temporal property**.



### Contribution

- Proposed a concept of sub-segment temporal adaptation, which faciliates loss-tolerant HAS based on new importance-based transmission order of video frames that allows partial segment decoding
- Introduced VQ threshold metric
- BETA can be used to reduce the set of encoding bitrates for a HAS stream to save on storage demands



### Video Coding Basics

The sequence of source video frames is converted into a coded bitstream and then transmitted over the network. The coded bitstream is a sequence of GOPs, each consisting a number of coded frames.

- I-frame: indicates the beginning of a GOP, references P, B, b-frames
- P-frame: depends on the I-frame, references B, b-frames
- B-frame: depends on the I-frame and P-frame(s), references b-frames
- b-frame: depends on the I-frame, P-frames(s) and B-frame(s), references nothing

Each GOP contains an I-frame, followed by a series of PBb sequences, where the number of non-reference b-frames could be anywhere between 1 and 16.

- Closed GOPs are used (with no temporal dependency across GOPs)
- GOP length is fixed
- GOP structure is fixed

### BETA Design Overview

Motivating questions:

- How can we help the client decode and play a partial segment, and discard some part of it when needed, to avoid a stall in the case of a sudden bandwidth reduction?
- Can we dynamically adjust the quality of the segment being downloaded by manipulating the temporal property?

Problems:

- A segment (containing one or a few GOPs) must be completely downloaded to be decoded
- Using QUIC cannot eliminate Head-of-Line Blocking (HoLB). It will exist at the segment level at the application layer, as next chunk cannot be played, even if delivered, until previous one has played fully.



#### Sub-segment Level Quality Adjustment

Frames in each segment are ordered according to their importance in the decoding process and are transmitted in this particular order to the client over HTTP



#### VQ Threshold

- A VQ threshold that defines the number of frames in each segment (in BETA-order) that must be received, so that the impact on VQ is minimized
- VQ threshold is determined on the server side while encoding the video, and is used by the BETA client-side algorithm to terminate the segment download



### BETA Server

#### Redefining Transmission Order

- Arrange I-frames first, then P-frames and B-frames, b-frames last
- Experiment shows that the percentage of b-frames that can be dropped without affecting VQ should be computed per segment
