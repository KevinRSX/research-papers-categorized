## Beta

### Motivation

- The buffer depletes due to one fundamental reason â€“ the client commits to downloading the segment that cannot complete before it is due to play

- Current VoD services:

  - Maintain a large buffer: waste of bandwidth
  - Replace original chunks with those of low quality: still does not guarantee stall-free experience

  Also, these methods result in lower visual quality (VQ)

- An ideal solution to live broadcasts' high requirement of low latency should be agile and robust to bandwidth variation in real time, and mitigate the consequences of sudden bandwidth reduction in a graceful manner

- Bandwidth Efficient Temporal Adaptation: enables HAS systems to adjust quality **at sub-segment granularity** and to play partially received segments by **exploiting temporal property**.



### Contribution

- Proposed a concept of sub-segment temporal adaptation, which faciliates loss-tolerant HAS based on new importance-based transmission order of video frames that allows partial segment decoding
- Introduced VQ threshold metric
- BETA can be used to reduce the set of encoding bitrates for a HAS stream to save on storage demands



### Video Coding Basics

The sequence of source video frames is converted into a coded bitstream and then transmitted over the network. The coded bitstream is a sequence of GOPs, each consisting a number of coded frames.

- I-frame: indicates the beginning of a GOP, references P, B, b-frames
- P-frame: depends on the I-frame, references B, b-frames
- B-frame: depends on the I-frame and P-frame(s), references b-frames
- b-frame: depends on the I-frame, P-frames(s) and B-frame(s), references nothing

Each GOP contains an I-frame, followed by a series of PBb sequences, where the number of non-reference b-frames could be anywhere between 1 and 16.

- Closed GOPs are used (with no temporal dependency across GOPs)
- GOP length is fixed
- GOP structure is fixed
